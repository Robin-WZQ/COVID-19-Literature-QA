our understanding of the association of coronavirus disease 19 ( covid - 19 ) and preterm or early term birth among racially and ethnically diverse populations and those with chronic medical conditions is limited
sex , onset month , age group , city of residence
there has not been evidence suggesting the link between covid - 19 and asthma exacerbation
D - dimer , interleukin ( IL ) - 6 and cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) were excluded from the analysis because they were not routinely tested in the cohorts
other groups at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions or morbid obesity
to the best of our knowledge , the association between severe covid - 19 and dermatologic comorbidities has not been reported
when some patients ignore their mild symptoms at the beginning or a potential carrier cannot get tested immediately
population growth and seasonality will generally drive some part of the month - to - month change in employment
